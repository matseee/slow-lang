# slow-lang

a slow, fragile and simply designed interpreter for the programming language slow-lang.

Its only purpose is to teach myself more about interpreted programming
languages and the structure of interpreters itself.
All work is based on Thorsten Ball's Book "Writing an interpreter in
go".
You can find it [here](https://interpreterbook.com/).
