# slow-lang [![Build Status](https://ci.matse.dev/api/badges/matse/slow-lang/status.svg)](https://ci.matse.dev/matse/slow-lang)

a slow, fragile and badly designed interpreted programming language.

Its only purpose is to teach myself more about interpreted programming
languages. All work is based on Thorsten Ball's Book "Writing an interpreter in
go". You can find it [here](https://interpreterbook.com/).
