# slow-lang

a slow and badly designed interpreter language.

Its only purpose is to teach myself more about programming languages and why
different languages have their own weaknesses. All the work is based on Thorsten
Ball's Book "Writing an interpreter in go"
([interpreterbook.com](https://interpreterbook.com/)).
